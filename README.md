# Caesar Cipher Python
Welcome to the Caesar Cipher Python script repository! This script allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher technique.

## What is Caesar Cipher?
Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique used in ancient times by Julius Caesar to secure messages. It works by shifting each letter in the message by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet.

## How to Use
### Requirements
- Python 3.x
### Steps to Use:
1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine or download the `PRODIGY_CS_01(Caesar Cipher).py` file directly.

2. **Run the Script:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where `caesar_cipher.py` is located.
   - Run the script by typing `python caesar_cipher.py`.

3. **Choose an Option:**
   - When prompted, choose whether you want to encrypt or decrypt a message.
   - Enter your message and the desired shift value (a number indicating how many positions each letter should be shifted).

4. **View Results:**
   - The script will display the encrypted or decrypted message based on your input.

## Example
Suppose you want to encrypt the message "HELLO" with a shift of 3:
- Original Message: HELLO
- Encrypted Message: KHOOR

Decryption works similarly, where you input the encrypted message and use a negative shift value to reverse the process.
